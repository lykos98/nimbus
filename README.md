# Nimbus project
Self build weather sensor network, experimenting on esp32, WiFi, LoRa and much more. 

## Aim of the project 
Hi! I am a PhD student in Data Science and I love to build stuff with microcontrollers and similar things. 
Here I will document my journey in building my weather sensors network, something like [https://sensor.community] but with more flexibility.

The idea is to open source all the kits, parts and codes, and also the instructions to build weather stations. 
Maybe one day to share these kits among people, and to grow a community around citizen science. 


## TODO
Frontend:
- fix thing date in axis of plots
- fix selector on date and coherence between date of the container and date of the host
- fix padding of graph container div
- add loading screen when dealing with graphs
- improve overall look
